From York Fort to the mouth of Chuckitanaw river Canoes may be navigated pretty easy; above this river the Water becomes shoal.

Here the Natives have a stage built across, on which they stand to spear Sturgeon, stopping the passage with long sticks stuck in the ground a small space asunder, unsupported at top: The Sturgeon, swimming against these stakes, shake them; which directs the Natives where to strike. This river is well stored with Guinards & other fish; Put up here, Kaiskatchewan river[^july-1772-9] in sight: We killed eleven sturgeon & a few Tickomeg (i.e.) Guinaids[^july-1772-10] & one black Bear; A seasonable supply being greatly in want: The Pedlar, Mr. Currie[^july-1772-11] (who intercepted great part of York Fort trade this year)[^july-1772-12] is one days paddling below this river, at Cedar Lake: Laid up a fifth reserve of tobacco. Sounded 6 fathoms in Outeatowan lake on the. N.W. side where we paddled about S.W. 27 miles, then came at a small river named Kippahagan Sepee (i.e.) Shut up river and paddled a small distance in it. Course South 42 West, distance 30 miles.

[^july-1772-13]: Dr. Eliott Coues notes one Joseph Primeau, interpreter of the North-West Company, at Fort des Prairies in 1804. Probably the same name, though not same man. Lewis Primo's connection with both Cocking and Samuel Hearne is made clear in Miss Agnes Laut's Conquest of the Great Northwest.
