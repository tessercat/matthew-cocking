## October 1772

October 2. Friday. Snow at times. We are preparing to proceed to-morrow when we shall separate for the winter-season: This day was spent in feasting on berries, which are now going out of season; & a farewell smoking.

October 3. Saturday. We did not proceed: Smoking the Grand Calimut & several speeches made by the Leaders: Two looking-glasses with several other trifles were presented: these were to be given to the ground to induce it to favour them with plenty of furs & provisions: They have a notion that these gifts have a great effect: & when anything happens contrary to their desires they commonly use this method to appease the ill Domon. When sick they are very foolish, for they throw away many necessaries, also present to others as payment for singing their god-songs that they may recover; so that if the sick person recovers, He is a poor wretched Creature having scarce any thing to cover his nakedness.

October 4. Sunday. We did not proceed: The men singing their Buffalo Pound songs.

October 5. Monday. We proceeded: two tents going Southerly: Our Course West & distance 14 miles: At present six tents: The country hillocks: soil sandy, & barren in the vallies. Saw a few Snow-buntings.

October 6. Tuesday. Travelled 8 miles W.b.N.: Country very barren: Saw several Stone heaps on the tops of the high hills; which the Natives say were gathered by the Archithinue Natives, who used to lie behind these heaps, reconnoitering the Country round: We pitched on the side of a lake, the water disagreeable, bitterish salt taste; salt laying on the surface an inch thick (A specimen of which I have preserved) & on the shore like rime in a frosty morning: We made use of Buffalo dung for fuel & it answered very wel.

October 7. Wednesday. We did not proceed: Buffalo at present very scarce. I found in an old tent-place belonging to the Archithinue Natives, part of an earthen vessel, in which they dress their victuals; It appeared to have been in the form of an earthen pan. Saw several Wolves.

October 8. Thursday. We proceeded: Our Course about W.b.N.1/2N. & distance 9 miles: Country very unlevel, but the Hills not so high: Saw two salt lakes: Fresh water scarce.

October 9. Friday. We did not proceed: A heavy rain last night: Male Buffalo our food at present; very poor excepting in the spring. N.B. - All over the Country where Buffalo resort are many hollow places in the ground,[^october-1772-1] made by the Bulls in the covering season.

[^october-1772-1]: Buffalo wallows - they rolled in the wallows until caked with mud and so found a measure of protection from the assaults of flies and mosquitoes.

October 10. Saturday. We proceeded: Our Course West & distance 2 miles, arriving at the ridge of small poplars where the Natives intend to trap the winter season. Two tents separated from us, going more northerly: We were obliged to dig in a low plot of ground to obtain water.

October 11 to 13. Sunday to Tuesday. We did not proceed: Busy building traps for Wolves; Numbers around us; so that we have the prospect of good luck.

October 14. Wednesday. This day an Indian Man, belonging to those who separated from us, was brought to my tent, having fallen from his Horse & broke his leg: I did & shall do all in my power to get him well again.

October 15. Thursday. The Indians belonging to the lame man joined me.

October 16 to 19. Friday to Monday. The lame man doing well: Busy trapping: good success: several Smokes near us which we suppose are our Friends the Archithinue Natives:, The Natives shew me a tobacco plantation[^october-1772-2] belonging to the Archithinue Indians about 100 yards long & 5 wide, sheltered from the northern blasts by a Ledge of poplars; & to the Southward by a ridge of high ground.

[^october-1772-2]: On Indian tobacco, see Hendry's Journal, note (R.S.C., 1907, II, 339).

October 20. Tuesday. We are preparing to proceed to-morrow, to be in readiness for pounding Buffalo at an Archithinue pound.

October 21. Wednesday. We did not proceed as intended, waiting to kill Buffalo which were seen in great droves this morning.

October 22. Thursday. We proceeded to the Pound: Course S.S.W. & distance 6 miles: The lame man on the mending hand. Course corrected since September 21st South 60Â° West & distance 48 miles. From York Fort to the Buffalo pound. Course by true Compass South 48 West. Distance 752 miles.

October 23. Friday. Every person repairing the Beast pound.[^october-1772-3] It is a circle fenced round with trees laid one upon another, at the foot of an Hill about 7 feet high & an hundred yards in Circumference: the entrance on the Hill-side where the Animal can easily go over; but when in, cannot return: From this entrance small sticks are laid on each side like a fence, in form of an angle extending from the pound; beyond these to about 1 1/2 mile distant. Buffalo dung, or old roots are laid in Heaps, in the same direction as the fence: These are to frighten the Beasts from deviating from either side. This pound was made by our Archithinue friends last spring, who had great success, many Skulls & Bones lying in the pound. Several Buffalo seen near at hand, & the Young men endeavoured to drive them beyond the pound but without success.

[^october-1772-3]: See note on buffalo and buffalo pounds - Hendry's Journal (R.S.C., 1907, II, 333).

October 24. Saturday. Wolves, Foxes, the Roebuck; another Animal of the Deer kind named  Pistaticoos,[^october-1772-4] but something less in size; plenty of Hares; pheasants; Crows; Magpies & small Birds of the same kind as to the Northward: Red Deer are scarce. Snow fell last night.

[^october-1772-4]: Probably antelope.

October 25 to 26. Sunday to Monday. Snow at times: Natives employed trapping & endeavouring to drive Buffalo to the pound but without success. We are, not so expert at pounding as the Archithinue Natives.

October 27 to November 3. Tuesday to Tuesday included the 3rd November. Snow all dissolved: Natives trapping & killing Buffalo with the Bow and Arrows: And in the Evenings Conjuring & feasting.
