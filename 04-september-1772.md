## September 1772

September 1. Tuesday. We travelled along the branch: Course W.S.W. & distance about 14 miles.

September 2. Wednesday. We did not proceed: A large drove of Female Buffalo from the Westward crossed the river near our tents, but were drove back by the Natives who killed several.

September 3. Thursday. We proceeded: Our Course S.W.b.W. distance 5 miles: travelling along the river. Here we met with a poor forlorn French-man, along with a few Asinepoet Natives. He tells me that He left Francois the French Pedlar[^september-1772-1] 7 years ago on account of ill usage: & hath been with the Natives over since; I gave him a small supply of Tobacco & other necessaries. Course Corrected for five days past South 61° West, distance 41 miles.

[^september-1772-1]: Evidently one of the French traders who remained in the west after the conquest. It is not clear if the name Francois is the Christian name or the surname. Possibly may be a corruption of the French surname Francoeur. A Joseph Francoeur was a voyageur of the North-West Company in 1804. Not likely to be the same man, however.

September 4, Friday. Our Course about West, distance 9 miles: Travelled along the branch, put up at a Shallow Creek named Mikisew or little Eagle Creek: There we met with many Natives: The river full of small flats, very crooked, small poplars in places on the shores, and abundance of stone Currants; also small black-bemies: The Natives gather abundance of both sorts drying them in the sun for winter use.

September 5. Saturday. We did not proceed: This day I smoked with the Natives: the Leader promised not to go to war; I also gave them a supply of goods.

September 6. Sunday. We proceeded all in Company: Our Course West, distancé 12 miles. Leaving the river on one hand, came to some high land named Mikisew Wache, or Eagle hills[^september-1772-2] where we pitched: Poplar & Birch about 4 feet diameter in places; but mostly very small: plenty of moose & Waskesew at times, but at present scarce: Several ponds well stored with Ducks and some Geese. N.B. - The Natives here all took tent-poles to carry with them.

[^september-1772-2]: Eagle Hills and Eagle Hills Creek still known by same name. The latter empties into North Saskatchewan from the south, above the elbow.

September 7. Monday. We did not proceed.

September 8. Tuesday. We proceeded: travelling along the Hill-side: Our Course S.b.W. distance four miles.

September 9. Wednesday. Our course S.E.b.S. & distance 6 miles: several small ponds well stored with Ducks: We separated, part going Westerly towards Manito-Sakihagan & Assine-Wache.

September 13. Sunday. We did not proceed: Three Asinepoet Natives came to us from Manitow Sakahegan; they bring the disagreeable news that several of the Asinepoet Natives have been quarrelling through jealousy, & are intending to kill each other: this often is the case with these people.

September 14. Monday. Our Canoes E.S.E. distance 6 miles: Crossed the Creek named Mikisew Shipishish a second time: shallow as before: Indians say there are many Beaver in thie Creek: Hunters who went off early this morning killed four, fine food. Course corrected for six days past is 27° W. & distance 26 miles.

September 15. Tuesday. We did not proceed: Hunters had but small success in Beaver killing: The greatest part of our Company are intended to remain near this Creek for some time, to kill Beaver: Wolves are very numerous.

September 16. Wednesday. The Natives saw a Strange Horse to-day. & suppose it belongs to the Snake Indians, their Enemies.

September 17. Thursday. Indians killed several Buffalo: The Natives in general are afraid of the Snake Indians & say they are nigh at hand. This day I took an observation with an artificial Horizon in water but blowing fresh it was very imperfect. Latitude Pr. Account 48°43 North (N.B. - "Very imperfect indeed").

September 18. Friday. Ten tents of Asinepoet Natives came to us: they say they left several tents of Asinepoet Natives & Archithinue Natives[^september-1772-3] (their friends) two days' journey beyond Manitow-Sakahegan. N.B. - We have several pack-horses with us at present, lively clean made animals, generally about 14 hands high & of different colours.

[^september-1772-3]: Blackfeet.

September 19. Saturday. Hunters looking after Beaver but scarce: Smoked with the Asinepoet Strangers: I advised them to be diligent in trapping furs, & to go with me to the Company's Forts, most of them being strangers: but they seemed unwilling, saying, they were unacquainted with the method of building Canoes & paddling: However they would send their furs by their friends who yearly visit the forts.

September 21. Monday. We proceeded: Our Course about S.E. distance only a mile: Young men went a hunting: Indians sickly. Latitude by an Artificial Horizon 52°13" N. Course from York Fort to this place by true Compass, South 56 Wt. Distance 536 miles.

September 24. Thursday. Travelled 3 miles S.E.: the Asinepoet Natives that last arrived going N.W.: Others with Neheathaway Indians[^september-1772-4] going easterly: all to trap Wolves, & pound Buffalo; at present only eight tents.

[^september-1772-4]: Crees. In Henry Kellsey's journal the name is spelled Nayhaythaway. Edward Umfreville, in his "Present State of Hudson Bay," gives Nehethawa.

September 25. Friday. We did not proceed: The Hunters saw several strange Horses; but they are such notorious liars, often giving false alarms, there is hardly any believing them.

September 26. Saturday. Plenty of provisions, so we did not proceed: The strange Horses that were seen yesterday proves to be a false alarm.

September 27. Sunday. Travelled twelve miles S.W.b.S. crossed Mikisew-Sepishish a third time; Buffalo feeding on all sides: Barren unlevel country.

September 28. Monday. Travelled five miles S.W.b.S. Country as before: A barren sandy soil, very little grass, mostly wild Wormwood which the Natives name Mustoose or Buffalo-liking: from that Animal being very fond of this Herb: Natives killed 4 Beaver.

September 29. Tuesday. We did not proceed: Hunters looking after Beaver, but had small success: A plentiful Country of provisions, for when the present stock is expended, an Indian need only mount his Horse, taking his Gun or Bow, & in a short time return with his Horse loaded with meat, supplying his neighbours also.
