May 3 to 4. Monday. Our Canoes are in. great foreward

May 5. Wednesday. An Indian came from those down the river: Informs me that many are sickly, & that-we are much forewarder than they in building our Canoes; that they have been fighting, occasioned by the liquor presented to them by, the-pedlars.[^may-1773-]

May 6 to 15. Thursday, 6th, to the 15th instant. Musquitoe: plenty & troublesome: after a shower of rain intolerable: Canoes ready: & we propose setting out to-morrow for York Fort. We have'a good stock of food, Viz., Buffalo flesh & several bladders of fat.

[^may-1773-] Opin 1, atm order to have pes AA. vented the Natives trom visiting the Canadians, Mr, Cocking should hay  taken, a Station underneath alt his Natives."

May 19. Wednesday. Paddled down the river & came to ieven tents, of Natives embarking: Entered the joining of the briinches:[^may-1773-] By marks we find the Natives up the other branch, have not passed downwards yet.

May 20. Thursday. Arrived at Francois Settlement, where we landed. found Lonis Primo tented on the Plantation, with S.tenté-of 1 ani informed that 30 Canoes are gone on before, & are to wait £6" n thet have teated the richer fure here. On our erival the French mai Se, introduced the Natives unto his houze, giving about 4 inches of tobacco; Afterwards they made a collection of furs, by the bulk about 100 Beaver: presenting them to the Pedler: who, in return, presented to them about 4 Gallons liquor, Rum adulterated: also cloathed 2 Leaders with a Coat & Hat. I endeavoured all in my power to prevétit the Natives giving away their fars, put in vain; Liquor being above all persuasion with thom: Francois forms me, that he shall embark very soon with his furs, having expended almost his goods. His House is @ long squares built log on log: half of it is appropriated to the use of a kitchen: the other half used as a trading room, & Bed-room; with a loft above, the whole length of the building where We lays his furs: also three small og houses; the Men's apartments: the whole enclosed with ten feet jockades, forming a Square about twenty yards.- The Canoes are eac 24 feet long: extreme breadth 5 quarters: and 23-inches deep: I believe Francois hath about twenty men, all french Canadians.

May 21. Friday. We did not procecd: None of the Indians are trading with Francois, for this reason; He hath no goods left: but Mis Servants enter our tents with Baubles, &c. which the Natives (children like) parchese at any rate, An Indian gave four Wolves for a Tomahawk Another a Beaver, for a small tin Breakfastplate; & a third a Beaver for Yryard of worsted lace, A. General Suioking with the Natives, when I advised ikem to embark; which they promised to do tomorow. I thal] remain here a few days, im hopes to sce gonte of the Natives who have not yet come down.

May 22. Saturday. The Natives were unwilling to embark without me, therefore I promised to proceed the major part with Louis yrimo set off. 1 have been twice into Saswee's dwelling house by invita- tion, to oat with him which I did not think necessary to refuse: He is old ignorant Frenchman: T do not think that he keeps a proper flistance from-his men; they coming into his apartment & talking with him as one of themeelves. But what I am most surprised at, they keep no watch in the night; even when the Natives are lying..on their plan- tation.

Here we met With § tents of Strangers: also our Indians who set off before me: The Strangers hath traded their furs with the Pedler who resides on this side Basquia, 1 observe plenty of french goods amongst them.
