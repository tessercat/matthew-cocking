## May 1773

May 2. Sunday. Sent two Young men to the Natives down the river with a present of tobacco, with orders to desist going to the pedlars.

May 3 to 4. Monday. Our Canoes are in great forewardness.

May 5. Wednesday. An Indian came from those down the river: Informs me that many are sickly, & that we are much forewarder than they in building our Canoes; that they have been fighting, occasioned by the liquor presented to them by the pedlars.[^may-1773-1]

[^may-1773-1]: Andrew Graham notes: - "My Opinion is, that in order to have prevented the Natives from visiting the Canadians, Mr. Cocking should have taken a Station underneath all his Natives."

May 6 to 15. Thursday, 6th, to the 15th instant. Musquitoes plenty & troublesome: after a shower of rain intolerable: Canoes ready; & we propose setting out to-morrow for York Fort. We have a good stock of food, Viz., Buffalo flesh & several bladders of fat.

May 16. Sunday. We embarked & paddled a small distance; stopping to kill Buffalo & Waskesew: Several grazing in sight.

May 17 to 18. Monday & Tuesday. Paddled down the river slowly.

May 19. Wednesday. Paddled down the river & came to seven tent, of Natives embarking: Entered the joining of the branches:[^may-1773-2] By marks we find the Natives up the other branch, have not passed downwards yet.

[^may-1773-2]: Forks of the Saskatchewan.

May 20. Thursday. Arrived at Francois Settlement, where we landed: found Louis Primo tented on the Plantation, with 5 tents of Natives. I am informed that 30 Canoes are gone on before, & are to wait for us: they have traded the richest furs here. On our arrival the French man introduced the Natives unto his house, giving about 4 inches of tobacco; Afterwards they made a collection of furs, by the bulk about 100 Beaver; presenting them to the Pedler: who, in return, presented to them about 4 Gallons liquor, Rum adulterated: also cloathed 2 Leaders with a Coat & Hat. I endeavoured all in my power to prevent the Natives giving away their furs, but in vain; Liquor being above all persuasion with them: Francois informs me, that he shall embark very soon with his furs, having expended almost his goods. His House is a long squares; built log on log: half of it is appropriated to the use of a kitchen: the other half used as a trading room, & Bed-room; with a loft above, the whole length of the building where He lays his furs: also three small log houses; the Men's apartments: the whole enclosed with ten feet stockades, forming a Square about twenty yards. The Canoes are each 24 feet long: extreme breadth 5 quarters: and 22 inches deep: I believe Francois hath about twenty men, all french Canadians.

May 21. Friday. We did not procecd: None of the Indians are trading with Francois, for this reason; He hath no goods left: but Mis Servants enter our tents with Baubles, &c. which the Natives (children like) parchese at any rate, An Indian gave four Wolves for a Tomahawk Another a Beaver, for a small tin Breakfastplate; & a third a Beaver for Yryard of worsted lace, A. General Suioking with the Natives, when I advised ikem to embark; which they promised to do tomorow. I thal] remain here a few days, im hopes to sce gonte of the Natives who have not yet come down.

May 22. Saturday. The Natives were unwilling to embark without me, therefore I promised to proceed the major part with Louis primo set off. I have been twice into Saswee's dwelling house by invitation, to eat with him; which I did not think necessary to refuse: He is old ignorant Frenchman: I do not think that he keeps a proper distance from his men; they coming into his apartment & talking with him as one of themselves. But what I am most surprised at, they keep no watch in the night; even when the Natives are lying on their plantation.

May 23. Sunday. In the morning I embarked according to my promise, & paddled down the river: All the who are waiting for their Friends that are not yet arrived. I left with them three considerable presents of tobacco, to be given to the Natives who are to follow us; at the same time to be as speedy as possible, as I shall wait for them below: I left behind three tents of Natives, who had expended their furs. In the afternoon met with ten Canoes coming up the river, who had traded their furs at the settlement below.

May 24 to 25. Monday & Tuesday. Paddling down the river: We were joined by 6 Canoes, supposed to have traded with the Pedlars: having no furs.

May 26. Wednesday. We proceeded in the morning & soon arrived at the noted Fishing place for Pike, &c. Here we met With 8 tents of Strangers; also our Indians who set off before me: The Strangers hath traded their furs with the Pedler who resides on this side Basquia. I observe plenty of french goods amongst them. It surprises me to perceive what a warm side the Natives hath to the French Canadians.

May 27. Thursday. Proceeded; & in the afternoon arrived at Basquia, where were six tents of Indians; also the Pedler mentioned yesterday lying in a tent with four Canadians, all French extraction: He hath only one large Canoe full of Furs: have sent two down to the Grand portage: he is going down himself in a few days: Louis primo tells me he is going down also, to see his friends: I told him that he was doing wrong as he was under a written contract to serve the Company: but all to no purpose.

May 28. Friday. We proceeded with all the Natives that had furs.

May 29. Saturday. We proceeded. & arrived at Kippahagan Sepee, which we entered, leaving Saskatchewan River. Here we pitched our tents. We found one tent of Natives iuere who have traded all their Furs with the Canadians one days journey from here, & ten Canoes are gone by the Lake Winnip√©g all bound fo York Fort

May 30. Sunday. Proceeded & entered Oateatawan Lake, arrived at the Fishing place, where we killed a few large Pike & Buddagh trout, each weighing above Thirty pounds weight. Afterwards we proceeded & lay on one of the Islands. A Great Swell in the lake.

May 31. Monday. Paddled over the Lake & came into Manihagow River. We passed over the Carrying places. The Natives are very brisk not stopping to hunt.
