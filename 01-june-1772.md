## June 1772

June 27. Saturday. This day at noon took my departure from York Fort in Lat. 57Â° 00". The Indians were unwilling to proceed, being such bad weather; and two of them becoming sickly so we put up for the night, four miles above the Fort.

June 28. Sunday. We did not proceed.

June 29. Monday. At 7 A.M. proceeded, but my Canoe mate died; we put up for the night.

June 30. We proceeded, tracking our Canoes at intervals against a strong current.
