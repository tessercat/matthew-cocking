August 4. Tuesday. Proceeded: Paddled, Dragged, & Carried our Canoes & Goods at intervals. Plenty of wild fowl: Here I met with a York Fort Leader who had not been down this summer. He denied having traded with the pedlars; but the Canadians goods that were in their possession contradicted his Assertion. Paddled about a mile West in the river, then came to Maneshashsquatanan lake again, and paddled about 2 miles N.W. in it; when after two Carriadges; & dragging Canoes thro' swamps 2 miles N.W. nearly, we entered Saskatchewan again, and paddled for about 12 miles in it W.S.W., then put up for the night. About a mile below which place, on the North side of the river, is a place whore the Natives tell me that the Beaver Indians[^august-1772-4] carry their goods & canoes into a Lake named Menistaguatakow:[^august-1772-5] this Carrying place is named Menistick-Minikqueuskow.

August 6. Thursday. Proceeded: we met a Canoe going down to the Natives we saw yesterday, informed us that a Canoe was waiting a little farther on to assist us; We expect to see them to-morrow. After paddling about 4 miles nearly S.W. We passed a branch of the river which runs W.b.S. & which the Natives say joins the river again a long way up the Country. It is named little Sturgeon river; We caught some here: a little before we put up for the night passed an opening bearing S.b.Wt. which joins the river a little above Basquia, being a small branch;[^august-1772-6] Course So. 32 Wt. distance 14 miles.

In Saskatchewan river. Our Course So. 48° Wt., distance 20 miles. N.B. Passed an opening that bore S.b.E. (a little before we put up for the night) named Peatagow river.[^august-1772-7]

[^august-1772-7]: Not to be confused with Hendry's Peatago river - the Carrot.

Here the Natives always wait for their Friends: Formerly the French had a House here.[^august-1772-10] Course corrected S. 39° Wt., 14 1/2 miles distance.

[^august-1772-10]: Fort La Corne. See Hendry's Journal (R.S.C., 1907, II, 311).

August 12. Wednesday. We did not proceed. I am informed that there are 18 tents of Natives a short distance off: I am also informed that Sesiwappow's son is grieved for the loss of his father, & is going to war to revenge his death: Such is the superstition & wild notions of the natives. The Natives rejoice that the journey from the Fort is ended; Indeed we have been forty-five days in performing what they used to be only twenty days other years, when healthful: Musquetoes hath been troublesome without intermission all the way, at the Carrying places especially; the Dress we were obliged to wear afforded us but little defence against them: I found it impossible to make any remarks of the force of the Currents, depth of water, &c., the Canoes not being constructed for such experiments: As to the Falls & Shoals, Vessels (i.e.) Large Canoes must be carried over: I have been particularly careful to be impartial in the account I have given, not exaggerating, but rather leaning to the favourable side.

August 13. Thursday. We travel tomorrow: A Child died this day. I laid by a sixth reserve of tobacco & a few ball.

August 14. Friday. We travelled 6 miles S.W.b.S. Country hilly, producing short Grass, low willows & ponds in places; also many vermin holes: our Course very uncertain; I found it inconvenient to use the Compass: Indian Leaders, whom the Natives say are intending to go to war, are many: but we expect to see some of them before the season for expeditions: when I hope to prevail on them to desist. The Friends of the Child who died Yesterday, make great lamentation, pricking themselves with Arrows in the Arms, sides, thighs and legs & the women scratching their legs &c. with flints.

August 15. Saturday. Travelled over several hillocks named Birch-hills. Strawberries, Rasp and Hip-berries in abundance: Course S.W.b.S., distance three miles; more Hillocks in sight as per Course named Waskesew Hills: Indians killed 2 Waskesew.

August 16. Sunday. Travelled S.W.b.S. 9 Miles: Country as yesterday: Saw a few straggling Ducks in small ponds in the Valleys: Indians tell me that in Winter buffalo are plenty here, which is confirmed by the quantity of Dung on the ground. Natives killed 3 Waskesew.

August 17. Monday. Travelled 6 miles W.S.W., over a grassy, shrubby country; Abundance of wild Wormwood, Mynth & other Herbs like Sage & Baum: but not of the same favour.

August 18. Tuesday. We did not proceed: Women employed gathering small nuts: An Indian joined us who confirms the account that many Natives are preparing for War.

August 19. Wednesday. Travelled G miles S.W.b.S.: The Natives are very dilatory in proceeding: their whole delight is to sit smoking and feasting: Yesterday I received invitations to no less than ten feasts.

August 20. Thursday. Travelled 7 miles W.S.W.: A Branch of Saskatchewan River bears West; distance 2 miles.

August 21. Friday. Travelled 8 miles S.W.b.W., passed some Hillocks named Birch Hills, and Younger Brothers, that bore South; Woods appear to be growing on them: passed through some low swamps, Thickets & Ponds: Red Deer are numerous; also Grizzle Bears of the fierce kind; but as yet we have seen none. Buffalo dung very plenty: Natives killed many Red Deer: plenty of food; although the Red Deer is coarse food, it goes well down after feeding so long on fish.

August 22. Saturday. Travelled 9 miles S.W.b.S., came to a branch of Saskatchewan, River,[^august-1772-11] where we put up. The River here is about fifty yards wide, & a strong current: It abounds with small fish named Wepitsesish, much like a Guiniad in size and shape; Another fish named Nonahchekesish or little sucking fish; & another kind about a foot long: They all readily take hook baited with flesh. They inform'd me of another fish named Mithcowepitesish, or red toothed fish, something like a trout. Here we met with a Leader named Commeseskew, with 14 tents all of natives; They heard of Buffalo up this branch.[^august-1772-12]

[^august-1772-11]: South Saskatchewan river.

[^august-1772-12]: Andrew Graham adds this note: - "The above Leader was at York Fort fast summer with 4 canoes. Query. Where were the others. Answer: I suppose traded with the Canadians if they had collected any furs."

August 23. Sunday. Crossed the branch in temporary Canoes with bended sticks, & covered with parchment skins:[^august-1772-13] We put upon the opposite side: Hunters killed 2 Buffalo: The Natives all promise faithfully to go down to the Forts next year, & not to trade with the Pedlars: but they are such notorious liars there is no believing them. However, I shall preserve part of my goods until my return, to try what influence that will have: I find they consider an Englishman's going with them as a person sent to collect Furs; & not as an encouragement to them to trap furs, & come down to the Settlements.

[^august-1772-13]: "Bull-boats." See note to Hendry (R.S.C., 1907, II, 329).

August 24. Monday. We did not proceed: This day Hunters saw several Horses up the branch of the other side: They are all in general afraid, supposing the horses to belong to the Snake Indians[^august-1772-14] with whom they are always at variance.

[^august-1772-14]: These could hardly be the true Snakes, or Shoshones, whose usual habitat was the Yellowstone country. Alexander Henry, the younger, refers to Snake Indians in the Red River country, and Dr. Coues suggests that these may have been Sioux. Possibly Cocking's Snakes may also respond to the same identification, though somewhat out of Souix territory.

August 25. Tuesday. We proceeded; Our course about S.W.b.S., distance 6 miles: Travelling through a hilly, short grass country: A few small sticks and ponds in places, well stored with Ducks, abundance of stone currant trees, but no Rasp nor Strawberrie shrubs. We pitched on the edge of the barren ground; saw several Buffalo feeding; killed several with a Gun & Bow, &c. I saw two Snakes this day each about a yard long, quite harmless; The Indians handling them & putting them in their bosoms. Course & distance corrected for nine days past are as follows; Viz. Course South 35° west and Distance 61 miles.

August 26. Wednesday. We did not proceed: Hunters killed several Buffalo. This day I took an Observation per noon Altitude. Latitude 52° 37" North.

August 27. Thursday. We did not proceed: A smoke see the way we intended going: As they are uncertain whether it is made by Friends or Foes, Some young men are going off to-morrow to reconnoitre. I have given a small present of Tobacco to be smoked if they are friends.

August 28. Friday. Travelled 12 miles W.b.S. Country rather leveller than before; very short grass, with plenty of Wild wormwood; Many Marmot[^august-1772-15] holes, the Indians killed several; & esteem them good eating; plenty of Buffalo in sight on all sides; Males and Females in separate herds; which the Natives inform me they always are, except in the covering season. No wood until we pitched in a long narrow ledge of small poplar.

[^august-1772-15]: Spermophiles or "ground squirrels."

August 29. Saturday, Travelled 5 miles W.S.W. along the ledge: At two miles off a narrow ridge of high land which bore North about 8 miles distant (A branch of Saskatchewan river runs on this side) named Menachinahshew Hills. They tell me of large lake on the other side, abounding with large Jack-fish named Menawow Sakahegan; near these Hills others, named Sacketagow Hills; where the Asinepoet natives go yearly for Birch-rind to cover their Canoes: There are many large Hills beyond those where the Beaver Indians reside: this high land is the termination of the barren ground that way; the Country beyond being woody, abounding in martins, Waskesew, Moose; & farther on, Beaver. This day I laid by a seventh reserve of tobacco & Shot of sizes; also other goods for Spring use at the building of canoes.

August 30. Sunday. We did not proceed: few Buffalo to be seen.

August 31. Monday. Travelled 5 miles W.S.W. Came to the other. branch of Saskatchewan river[^august-1772-16] where we pitched: narrow with abundance of Flat Islands, but good water for Canoes, & no Falls. Saw several Buffalo on the other side coming towards us, some Young Men, who went off in the morning, driving them this way, by making several fires of Buffalo dung to windward.

[^august-1772-16]: North Saskatchewan, somewhere about The Elbow.
