12, Wednesday. We aid not proveed. I am informed that there 
are 18 tents of Natives a short distance off: I am also informed that 
Sesiwappow's son is grieved {df the loss of his father, & is going to war 
to revenge his death: Such is the superstition & wild notions of the 
natives. The Natives rejoice that the journey from the Fort: is ended; 
Indeed we have beon forty-five days in performing what they used to be 
only twenty dass other years, when héalthful: Musquetoes hath been 
troublesome without intermission all the way, at, the Carrying places 
especially; the Dress we were obliged to wear afforded us but little de- 
fence against them: I found it impossible to make any remarks of the 
force of the Currents, depth of water, &., the Canoes not baing con- 
etructed‘for such experiments: As to the Falls & Shoals, Vessels (i.e.) 
Large Canoes must be carried over: I have been particularly careful to 
‘be impartial in the account T have given, not exaggerating, but rather 
leaning to the favourable side. 
* 13. Thureday. We travel tomorrow: A Child died this day. I 
Iaid by a sixth reservo of tobacco & a few ball. 
14. Friday. We travello] 6 miles S.W..8. Country hilly, pro- 
ducing short Grass, low willows & ponds in places; also many vermin: 
hholes: our Canrse very uncertain; I found it inconvenient to use the 
Compass: Indian Leaders, whom th Natives say are intending’to go to 
war,,are many: but wFe expect to eee some of them beforg the season for 
:peditions : whersT hope to prevail on them to desif-"The-Friends 
of the Chilil who died Yesterday, make great lamentation, pricking 
themselves with Arrows in the Arma, sides, thighs and legs & the women 
seratching their legs &c. with flints, 
15, Saturday. ‘Travelled over several hillocks named Birch-hills. 
Strawberries, Rasp and Hip-berries in abundance: Course S.W.b.S., 
distance three miles; more Hillocks in sight as per Course named Was- 
Kesew Hills: Indians killed 2 Waskecow. : 
16, Sunday. Travelled S.W.b.S. 9 Miles: Country as yesterday: 
Saw a few straggling Ducks in small ponds in the Valleys: Indians tell 
me that jp Winter buffalo are plenty here, which is confirmed by the 
Hef of Dung on the ground. Natives killed 3 Waskesew. 
17. Monday. Travelled. ¢ miles W.S.W., over a grassy, shrubby 
‘ountry; Abundance of wild Wotmwood, Mynth &-other Herbs like 
Sage & Baum: but not of the same favour. .

small-nits: An Indian joinéd us who confirms the account that many 
Natives are preparing. for War. 
19, Wednesday. Travelled G miles S.W.bS.: The Natives are 
ery dilatory in proceeding: their whole aclight is to sit smoking and 
feasting: Yestorday I received invitations to no less than ten feasts.

20. Thursday. Travelled 7 miles W.S.W.: A Branch of Sas- 
katchewan River bears West; distance 2 miles. 
21. Friday. Travelled 8 miles S.W.b.W., passed some Hillocks| 
named Birch Hills, and Younger Brothers, that bore South; Woods ap- 
pear to be growing on them: passed through some'low swamps, ‘Thickets 
& Ponds: Red Deer are numerous; also Grizzle Bears of the fierce kind; 
‘but a5 yet we have seen none. Buffalo dung very plenty: Natives killed 
many Red Deer: plenty of food; although the Red Deer is coarse food, 
it goes well down after feeding so long on fish. 
22, Saturday. Travelled 9 miles S.W.bS., came to a. branch of 
Saskatchewan, River,’ where we put up. ‘The River here is about fifty 
yards wide, & a strong current: It abounds with small fish named 
‘Wepitsesish, much like a Guiniad in size and shape; ‘Another fish named 
Nonahchekesish or liitle sucking fish ; & another kind about a foot long: 
‘They all readily take hook baited with flesh. They inform’d me of an- 
other fish named Mithcowepitesish, or red toothed fish, something like a 
trout. Here we met with a Leader named Commeseskew, with 14 tents 
all of natives; They heard of Buffalo up this branch 
23, Sunday. Crossed the branch in temporary Canoes with bended 
sticks, & covered with parchment skins:* We put upon’ the opposite 
side: Hunters killed 2 Buffalo: ‘The Natives all promise faithfully to 
go down to the Forts next year, & not to trade with the Pedlars: but they 
are such notorious liars there is no believing them. However, I shall 
preserve part of my goods until my return, to try whet influence that. 
will have: I find they consider an Englishman’s going with them asa 
person sent to collect Furs; & not as an encouragement to them to trap 
furs, & come down to the Settlements. 
‘24. Monday. We did not proceed: This day Hunters aw several 
Horses up the branch of the other side: They are all in general afraid, 
supposing the horses to belong to the Snake Indians * with whom they 
are always at variance. 
25. Tuesday. We proceoded ; Our course about 8.W:b.S., distance 
6 miles: Travelling through a hilly, short grass country: A few small

4 These could hardly be the true Snakes, or Shoshones, #ehose usual habitat 
‘was the Yellowstone country. Alexandcr Henry, the younger, refers to Snake 
Indians in the Red River country, and Dr, Coues busizests that these may have 
been Sioux. Possibly Cocking's Snakes may also respond to the same identi- 
feation, though somewhat out of Slotix territory.

currant trees, but no Rasp nor Strawberrie shrubs. We pitched on the 
edge of the barren ground; saw several Buffalo feeding; killed several 
with a Gin & Bow, &. Isaw two Snakes this day each about a yard 
long, quite harmless; ‘The Indiahs handling them & putting them in

21. Thursday. We did not proceed: A smoke see the way we 
intended_going: As they are uncertain whether it is made by Friends   
      or Foes, Some Fourig nien are going off to-morfow to reconnoitre. I - 
have given a small present of Tobacco to be smoked if they are friends, ° 
28. Friday. Travelled 12 miles W.b.S. Country rather leveller 
than before; very short grass, with plenty of Wild wormwood; Many 
Marmot? holes, the Indians killed several; & esteem them good cating; 
plenty of Buffalo in sight on all sides; Males and Females in separate 
herds; which the Natives inform me they always are, except in the cov- 
ering season. No wood until we pitched in a long narrow ledge of small 
poplar. : 
29. Saturday, Travelléd 5 miles W.S.W. along the ledge: At two 
miles off a narrow ridge of high land which bore Nortlt about $ miles 
distant {A brafch of Saskatchewan river runs on this side) named 
Menachinahshe‘Hills. ‘They tell me of large lake on the other side, 
abounding with large Jack-fsh named Menawow Sakahegan; near these 
Hills others, named Sacketagow Iiills; where the Asinepoct natives go 
yearly for Birch-rind to corer their Canoes: There are many large Hills 
‘beyond those where the Beaver Indians reside: this high land is'the 
termination of the barren ground that vay; the Country beyond being 
woody, abounding in martins, Waskesew, Moase; & farther on, Beaver. 
This day I laid by a seventh reserve of ,tobacto & Shot of sizes; alsd 
other goods for Spring use at the building of canoes.
