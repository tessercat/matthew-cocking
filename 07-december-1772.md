## December 1772

December 1. Tuesday. Our Archithinue friends came to us and pitched a small distance from us; on one side the pound 21 tents of them, the other seven are pitched another way. One of the Leaders talks the Asinepoet language well, so that we shall understand each other, as my Leader understands it also. This tribe is named Powestic-Athinuewuck (i.e.) Water-fall Indians. There are 4 Tribes, or Nations, more, which are all Equestrians Indians, Viz., Mithco-Athinuwuck or Bloody Indians, Koskitow-Wathesitock or Blackfooted Indians, - Pegonow or Muddy-water Indians & Sassewuck or Woody Country Indians.[^december-1772-1]

[^december-1772-1]: See introduction to Hendry's Journal (R.S.C., 1907, II, 316-318).

December 2. Wednesday. The Archithinue Natives repairing the pound, the repair we gave it on our arrival not being sufficient. Snow within the ledge about 8 inches deep in general.

December 3. Thursday. This day smoked with the Archithinue Natives & presented thie Leaders & principal men with tobacco, &c., As far as prudence would permit; at the same time by the mouth of my Leader I endeavoured to persuade two of them to accompany me on my return to the Fort, where they would meet with a hearty welcome, & receive many presents: but they said that they would be starved & were unacquainted with Canoes & mentioned the long distance: I am certain they never can be prevailed upon to undertake such journies.

December 4. Friday. The Archithinue Natives drove into the pound 3 male & one female Buffalo, & brought several considerable droves very near: They set off in the Evening; & drive the Cattle all night. Indeed not only at this Game, but in all their actions they far excell the other Natives. They are all well mounted on light, Sprightly Animals; Their Weapons, Bows & Arrows: Several have on Jackets of Moose leather six fold, quilted, & without sleeves. They likewise use pack-Horses, which give their Women a great advantage over the other Women who are either carrying or hauling on Sledges every day in the year. They appear to me more like Europeans than Americans.[^december-1772-2]

[^december-1772-2]: That is, natives of America - Indians.

December 5. Saturday. Our Archithinue Friends are very Hospitable, continually inviting us to partake of their best fare; generally berries infused in water with fat, very agreeable eating. Their manner of showing respect to strangers is, in holding the pipe while they smoke: this is done three times. Afterwards every person smokes in common; the Women excepted; whom I did not observe to take the Pipe. The tobacco they use is of their own planting, which hath a disagreeable flavour; I have preserved a specimen. These people are much more cleanly in their cloathing, & food, than my companions: Their Victuals are dressed in earthen pots, of their own Manufacturing; much in the same form as Newcastle pots, but without feet: their fire tackling a black stone used a flint, & a kind of Ore as a steel, using tuss balls as tinder, (i.e.) a kind of moss.

December 6. Sunday. No success in pounding: the Strangers say the season is past. A hungry prospect: Many of us and no great Store of provisions.

December 7 to 12. Monday. The Natives pounded a few Buffalo & presented to me my full share: Women, Children, & Slaves, feed on berries. The Slaves whom they have preserved alive are used with kindness, they are young people of both sexes, & are adopted into the families of those who have lost their children, either by War or sickness: They torture all the aged of both sexes in a most shocking & deliberate manner.

December 13. Sunday. Snowy weather. This day I sprained my ankle in running down a hill, I again spoke to the Strangers for two of their Young men to accompany me to the Fort; but could not succeed.

December 14 to 15. Monday & Tuesday. Smoked with the Hospitable Strangers & gave them what goods I could spare. Three Archithinue Natives, of the same tribe, came to us from the Westward; who say the Buffalo are scarce, & that their Countrymen are going to war with the Snake Indians.

December 16 to 17. Wednesday & Thursday. Snow at times: We left our Archithinue Friends[^december-1772-3] & proceeded back lo Mikisew-Wachee. Our Course about East and distance 6 miles.

[^december-1772-3]: Cocking has now reached the most westerly point - somewhere in the Great Plain between the North and South Saskatchewan. He turns back to the eastward.

December 18. Friday. Proceeded: our course about N.E. and distance about 6 miles: now in the barren ground obliged to use Buffalo dung for firing.

December 19. Saturday. Proceeded: Our Course about N.E. & distance 15 miles: arriving at the edge of Mikisew-Wachee where we pitched. Saw several Buffalo feeding, a joyful sight to hungry mortals; Food being the principal concern of my companions.

December 20. Sunday. Our employment to-day bringing the Buffalo that were killed yesterday.

December 21. Monday. We were joined by ten tents of Asinepoet Indians.

December 22. Tuesday. Joined by five tents of Asinepoet Indians. There are but few furs amongst us as yet.

December 23. Wednesday. A Young man, who came to us yesterday, shot himself through the lungs; the reason very trifling. This rash action was nearly the death of two of his friends, who intended to stab themselves, but were prevented by myself, & other bystanders. The Asinepoet Natives are oftentimes guilty of Suicide, on very childish grounds. I am informed Francois the Canadian pedlar, with 15 Canoes arrived in the Autumn, at the House mentioned 19th August.

December 24 to January 8, 1773. Thursday, 24th Dec. to 8th January, 1773. All hands employed making Snow-shoes, hunting for food, & such like exercises; Young Indian Men coming & going at times. I send by them presents of Tobacco: they inform me that few are gone, or intend going, to war the ensuing summer: but are to collect Furs & go down to the Company's settlements.
