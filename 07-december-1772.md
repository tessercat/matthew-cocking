## December 1772

December 1. Tuesday. Our Archithinue friends came to us and pitched smal] distance from us; on one side the pound 21 tents of them, the other-seven are pitched'another way. One of the Leaders talks the Asin- Poet language well, so that we shall understand each other, as my Leader understands jt also, This tribe is named" Powestio:Athinuewuck (ie) Water-fall Indians. There are 4 Tribes, or Nations, more, which are all Equestrians Indians, Viz., Mitheo-Athiniivack opie Indians, Kos- Kitow-Wathesitock or Blackfooled Indians—Pegonow or Muddy-water Indians & Sassewuck or Woody Country Indians.[^december-1772-]

December 2. Wednesday. The Archithinue Natives repairing the pound, the repair we gave it on our arrival not being suffcient.,-Snow within the ledge about 8 inches deep in general.

December 3. Thursday. This day smoked with the Archithinue Natives & presented thie Leaders & principal men with tobacco, &e., As forlas pri dence would permit; at the same time by the mouth of my Leader Ie endeavgured to persuade two of them to accompany me on my-refurn to the Fort, where they would meet with a hearty welcome, & receive many presents: but they said that.they would be starved & were unac- «uainted with Canoes & mentioned the-long distance: T am certain they ever ean be prevailed upon to undertake such journies,

December 4. Friday. The Archithinue Natives drove into the pound 3 male & one female Buffalo, & brought several considerable droves very near They set'off-in the Evening; & drive the Cattle all night. Indeed not only at this Game, but in all their actions they far excell the other Natives. They are all well mounted on light, Sprightly Animals; Their Weapons, Bows & Arrows: Several have on Jacketé of Moose leather six fold, quilted, & without slecves. They likewise use pack-Horses, which give their Women a great advantage over the other Women who are either carrying or hauling on Sledges every day in the year They ap- <4 pear to me more like Europeans than Americans.[^december-1772-]

December 5. Saturday. Our Archithinue Friends are very Hospitable, con. g tinually inviting us to partake of their best fare; gencfally berries in- fused in water with fat, very agreeable'eiting. Their manner of showing respect to strangers is, in holding the pipe while they smoke: this is done thres times. Afterwards every person smokes in common; the Women excepted; whom I did not observe to take the Pipe. The tobecco they use is of their own planting, whichyhath a disagrotable flavour; I . have preserved a specimen. These peopfe are much more cleinly in their cloathing, & food, than my companions: Thejr Vicluals are dressed. in earthen pots, of their own Manufacturing; much.in thé'same form as Newcastle pots, but without feet: their fire tackling a,blick stone used a flit, & a kind of Ore as a steel using tuss bells as tinder, (f.) a Kind of moss.[^december-1772-]

December 6. Sunday. No success in pounding: the Strangers say the season is past." A hungry prospect: Many of us and no great Store of pro visions.

December 7 to 12. Monday. The Natives pounded a few Buifalo & presented to me my full share: Women, Children, & Slaves, feed on berries.- The Slaves whom they have preserved alive are used with kindness, they are young people of both sexes, & are adopted into the families of those who have lost their children, either by War or sickness: They torture all the aged of both sexes in a most shocking & deliberate manner.

December 13. Sunday. Snowy weather. This day I sprained my ankle in running down a hill, I again spoke to the Strangers for two.of their Young men to accompany me to the Kort; but could xiot suoceed.

December 23. Wednesday. A Young man, who came to us yesterday, shot himself through the lungs; the reason very trifling. This rash action was nearly the deattrof two of his friends, who intended to stab them- selves, but were prevented by myself, & other bystanders. The Asinepoet Natives are oftentimes. guilty of Suicide, on very childish grounds. I am informed Franesis the Canadian podlar, with 15 Canoes. arrived in the Autumn, at the House mentioned 19th August
