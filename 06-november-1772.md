## November 1772

November 4. Wednesday. The expectation of seeing the Archithinue Natives is lost, which is a great disappointment to my Companions, who used to trade Horses & Buffalo skin Garments, for winter apparel; also Wolf-skins & other furs. Showed me a Coat without sleeves six fold leather quilted, used by the Snake tribe to defend them against the arrows of their adversaries. I shall be sorry if I do not see the Equestrian Natives who are certainly a brave people, & far superior to any tribes that visit our Forts: they have dealings with no Europeans, but live in a state of nature to the S.W. Westerly: draw towards the N.E. in March to meet our Natives who traffick with them.

November 5 to 10. Thursday to Tuesday. Snow: Natives cam make nothing of the pound, so are obliged to kill the Buffalo with the Gun, & Bow & Arrows. They have caught a few Wolves & Foxes, but not the number they might: They are an indolent thoughtless set of beings, never looking beyond the time present.

November 11. Wednesday. Most of the snow dissolved: Three tents of our Company unpitched this day, & proceeded back to Mikisew-Wachy: At present 3 tents of us: We are intending to remain here hoping to have greater success, now there are but few people. The Man who some time ago had his leg broke hath pitched from us, & is in a fair way of doing well. I get no rest at nights for Drumming, Dancing, &c.

November 12 to 20. Thursday to Friday. Freezing in the nights and thawing in the days; also snow at intervals: Saw a smoke to Southward, supposed to be the Snake Natives. We are expending our time in doing little more than feasting, &c.

November 21. Saturday. This day two Archithinue Natives came to us from the Southward: They left their friends 28 tents early this morning: They say their people will pitch this way now they are convinced we are friends: These are the people whose spmoke we saw on the 12th instant.

November 22. Sunday. The two Archithinue Strangers left us to inform their Countrymen who we were: There are three Leaders amongst them. I sent a small present of tobacco.

November 23 to 30. Monday &c. Snow. Weather so bad the Archithinue Natives cannot join us, several stragglers coming in. Frost as yet very moderate; Indeed when Winter is setting in it is disagreeable travelling.
