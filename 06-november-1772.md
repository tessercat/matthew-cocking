4, Wednesday. ‘Phe expectation of soeing the Archithinue Natives 
is lost, which is.a great disappointment to my Companions, who used to 
trade-Horses & Buffalo skin Garmenfs, for winter apparel; ‘also Wolf- 
skins & other furs. Showed me a Coat without sleeves six fold leather 
cuilted, used | by2the Snake tribe'to defend them against the arrows of, 
their adversatics, I shall be sorry if I do’not sep the Equestrian Natives = 
who are certainly a brave people, & far superior to any tribes that visi 
our Forts: they have dealings with no Europeans,.but live in a state of 
nature to the S.W. Westerly: “draw towards the N.B. in March to meet 
our Natives who traffick with jhem. : 
5 to 10. Thursday to Tuesday. Snoiv:-Natives cam make nothing 
of the pound, co aré obliged to Kill the Buffalo with the Gun, & Bow & 
Arrows: They have caught a few, Wolves & Foxes,-But not the number 
they might: ‘They are an indolent thoughtless set of beings, ngver look- 
ing beyond the time present 
11, Wednesday. Most of the snow dissolved: Three tents of our 
Company xunpitched this day, & proceeded back to Mikisew-Wachy: At 
present 5 tents of us: We are intending to remain here hoping to have 
greater success, now there are but few people. “The Man who some time 
ago had his leg broke hath pitched from us, & isin a fair way of doing 
well. I get no rest at nights for Drumming, Dancing, &e. 
*12 to 20. ‘Thursday. to Friday. Freezing in the nights and thawing 
in the days; also snow at intervals: Saw a smoke to Southward, sup- 
posed. to be the Snake Natives. We are expending our time in doing” 
little more than feasting, &c- 
21. Saturday. This day two Archithinue Natives came to us from 
the Southward: They left ‘their-frionds 28 tents early this morning: ,- 
The} say their people will pitch this way now they are convinced we are 
smoke we saw on the 12th instant, 
The two Arehithinue Strangers Teft ys to inform 
their Countrymen who we were: There are three Leaders amongst them.” 
Tent a small present of tobacco. 
+ 23 to 30. Monday, &e. Snow.’ Weather so bad the Archithinue 
Natives cannot join us, eeveral stragglers corhing in. Frost as yet very 
moderato; Indeed when Winter is setting in it is disagreeable travelling.
