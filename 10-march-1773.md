## March 1773

March 3. Wednesday. I with part of our Company 6 tents proceeded: Course East, distance 2 miles: The others gone to Sakitakow-Wachee.

March 4 to 26. Thursday, 4th, to Friday, 26th. Freezing in the nights & thawing in the days. Nothing material happened us. Young men employed in Collecting food & myself doing all in my power, to persuade the Natives to go with me to the Fort, & not to trade their Furs with Francois, nor Curry, whom we cannot avoid seeing on our way down: Notwithstanding all their fair promises, I am credibly informed that several hath been trading with the above two pedlars for Ammunition; & in sound policy they preserve their stock of Liquor, to intercept us on our way to the Settlements: I also heard the same from the Canadian Louis Primo who is in our service. I am certain he hath a secret kindness for his old Masters, & is not to be depended on. A melancholy affair happened a few days ago: An Asinepoet Native shot his Brother in the heat of passion. Such Actions are customary amongst these people, not only being guilty of murther, but killing themselves afterwards: Nay two will deliberately fire shot about, till one falls. They are a daring, bold, morose people; but they are very civil to me.

March 27. Saturday. We proceeded: Our Course N.E. & distance 10 miles, through Woody hummocks, with some large Ponds: We arrived at the Beast pound, where we met with my Leader again, with 4 tents of Neheathaway & 20 tents of Asinepoet Natives; The last are most part of them unacquainted with Canoes; the others, 30 tents of Neheathaway Natives, had unpitched, intending to proceed slowly towards the place of building Canoes, hunting as they go. Two Indians, who had been at Francois, are here: They inform me that Francois, the old French pedlar, has 6 large Canoes with him, & 3 Canoes more are lying at the Shallow Lake, on this side of Basquia: which I find is the Lake I paddled in the 1st day of August last: & 2 more Canoes are lying a little below Kippahagan Sepee, mentioned 23rd July. These with the 3 above mentioned are to come to him, on the breaking up of the rivers: He says 4 Canoes more are lying in the tract of the Natives who are more Southward, & who paddled down the Chuckitanaw river in their voyage to York Fort: & that several more Pedlars are lying all along to the Grand portage, to intercept the Natives who annually trade at Severn, Albany, & Moose Settlement. The name of the Grand portage is Kechy-Wenecop. Francois hath told the Natives, that He intended wintering with a few of his men at the Fork of the rivers sending down his Furs. He has at present collected as many prime furs as will load one large Canoe; traded chiefly from the Natives who are unacquainted with Canoes.

March 28 to April 3. Sunday, 28th March, to the 3rd April. Frosts & thaws. Natives pounded several Buffalo: they bring droves to the pound, but only few enter into it.
