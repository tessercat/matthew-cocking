Young men em- - ployed in Collecting food & myself doing all in my power, to persuade the Natives to go with me to the Fort, & not to trade-their Furs with Fran- ois, nor’ Curry, whom we eaiinot avoid sceing on our way down: .Not- withstanding all their fair promises, I am crodibly informed that-several hath boon trading with the abore two,pallars for Ammunition; & Sn ® — coand policy they preserve their stock of, Liquor, to intercept us on our way to the Settlements: I also heard the same from the Canadian Louis Primo who is in our service. Tam certain he hath a secret kindness for his old Masters, & is not to be depended on. A melancholy affair happened a few days ago: An Asinepoet Native shot his Brother in the heat of passion. Such Actions are customary amongst these people, not only being guilty’@Pmurther, but killing Uheinselves afterwards: Nay two will deliberatelt fire shot about, till one falls. "They are a daring, bold, morose people; but they are very civil to me.
