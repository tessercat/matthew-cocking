# Editor's notes 1908

Matthew Cocking's narrative may properly be regarded as a companion document to the Journal of Anthony Hendry, edited for the Royal Society last year, and published in the Transactions for 1907. The two Journals are closely related, although the journeys they describe stand nearly twenty years apart. Not only were they both undertaken with the same objects - the exploration of the vast unknown region to the westward of Hudson Bay, and the persuading of the far-western tribes to bring their furs down to the Bay; but they covered substantially the same ground. Both Hendry and Cocking started forth from York Fort, or York Factory as it is more familiarly known; both took the well-known Hayes route as far as Knee Lake, but from there struck off almost due west to Cross Lake on the Nelson, following a route evidently at that time familiar to the men of the Hudson's Bay Company, but afterward forgotten, so much so in fact that this strip of territory is to-day counted among the smaller unexplored areas of the country. From Cross Lake, both travellers followed the Minago River to Moose Lake, and thence smaller streams to the Saskatchewan. As a description of this portion of the route has already been given in connection with Hendry's Journal, it will not be necessary to repeat it here. Cocking, like Hendry, ascended the Saskatchewan to the mouth of the Pasquia - always an important point in the annals of the fur trade - and for a few miles farther their courses were identical, but at Saskeram Lake, to which Cocking applies the modest name of Maneneshahsquatanan Sakahegan, the two travellers took different roads. Hendry, it will be remembered, ascended Carrot River and then struck overland between Carrot River and the Red Deer, working around to the South Saskatchewan, which he crossed somewhere about Clark Crossing, north of the present town of Saskatoon, thence to the Elbow of the North Saskatchewan, and then over the Great Plain to the Red Deer branch of the South Saskatchewan, which he crossed somewhere about Kneehill Creek. Cocking, on the other hand, after traversing Saskeram Lake, again entered the Saskatchewan, which he ascended to a point not many miles below the Forks. He notes in his Journal, "Formerly the French had a House here." He was evidently about where the present H. B. post, Fort a la Corne, stands, and where the French fur-traders had a small establishment before the cession of Canada. From this place Cocking travelled overland, in a general south-westerly direction, crossing the South Saskatchewan somewhere below Clark Crossing, but striking Hendry's old trail once more at or about the Elbow of the North Saskatchewan, Following the southern bank of the North Saskatchewan, Cocking "put up at a shallow creek named Mikisew or little Eagle Creek," and then, leaving the river, he "came to some high land named Mikisew Wache, or Eagle hills." Eagle Hill Creek enters the North Saskatchewan some distance above the Elbow, and the Eagle Hills still bear the same name: so that Cocking's position can be accurately placed at this time. From the Eagle Hills, he journeyed out into the plains, following an erratic course, and constantly looking out for indications of the Archithinue Indians, or Blackfeet, as one of the main objects of his journey was to induce this important tribe or confederacy to trade their furs with the Hudson's Bay Company. He finally joined a considerable body of Blackfeet, and although he failed, as Hendry had done many years before, to persuade them to bring their furs down to the Bay, he spent some time among them, and has left us an exceedingly interesting and valuable account of their character, manners and customs at the time of his visit. Here, again, Cocking's narrative may profitably be compared with that of Hendry, who also has much to say about this remarkable tribe.

It may be noted that in both Hendry's and Cocking's cases, one of the main incentives to their expeditions inland was the increasing pressure of the rival fur-traders from Canada, a pressure which eventually was to thoroughly awaken the Hudson's Bay Company from the dream of a peaceful and comfortable monopoly of the fur trade, and convince them that if they would hold their own they must no longer rest content with a string of posts around the shores of Hudson Bay, but must strike boldly inland and meet the enterprising and very energetic Canadian traders on their own ground. In Hendry's day the Canadian fur-traders whose competition was beginning to arouse the alarm of the Hudson's Bay Company were French. When Cocking went inland, a couple of decades later, Canada had changed hands; but although the traders who now roamed far and wide throughout the immense fur country west of the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay were British, like the Hudson's Bay men themselves, the competition was much more bitter and strenuous than it had ever been before - which was, of course, entirely in keeping with the whole history of mankind.

Although the Hudson's Bay men contemptuously styled the Canadian traders "pedlers," they were too shrewd to ignore the strength of their competition, and it was no doubt a direct result of this journey of Cocking's that the year after his return to York Factory he was sent inland again by Chief Factor Andrew Graham, with Samuel Hearne, to build Cumberland House on the Saskatchewan. When Alexander Henry visited Cumberland House, in October, 1775, he found it "garrisoned by Highlanders, from the Orkney Islands, and under the command of a Mr. Cockings, by whom though unwelcome guests, we were treated with much civility." How long thereafter Cocking remained in charge of Cumberland House, or what his subsequent history may have been, there is no present means of knowing, nor is any information available as to his life previous to his remarkable journey from York Factory to the Blackfeet country.[^notes-1]

[^notes-1]: Some further particulars as to Cocking and his expedition inland with Hearne will be found in Agnes Laut's _Conquest of the Great Northwest_ - published since the above was written.

It may not be without interest to give two practically contemporary descriptions of the famous trading post of the Hudson's Bay Camp which was the starting-point of Cocking's expedition, as of so many other remarkable journeys in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The first of these is taken from Drage's "Account of a Voyage for the Discovery of a North-West Passage by Hudson's Straights, to the Western and Southern Ocean of America, performed in the Year 1746 and 1747;" and the second from Andrew Graham's account of the forts of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1771, as given in Dr. George Bryce's "Remarkable History of the Hudson's Bay Company," Chapter xiii.

"The situation of the Factory," says Drage, "is a clear Space made in the Woods, which surround it on three Sides, the Factory having an open Front to the Water, from which it stands a small Distance within the Bank; to the North and Eastward covered with a good Battery, and to the South-East is a Dock for building or repairing either Sloops or Boats; behind the Battery, and between that and the Dock, there is a Space of land which they call the Plantation, and here the Indians who come to the Factory pitch their Tents; and there is generally a Tent or two of old and infirm Indians, both Men and Wemen, who get their Maintenance from the Factory. This Part, which is on the Back of the Battery and Dock, and called the Plantation, is separated from the Factory by two Rows of high Palissades between the first of which and the second are Store-houses, the Cookery and some Workshops, low built, and so placed as they would be of little Service to an Enemy to cover an Attack of the Place. Within the inner Palissades are small Spots of Turnips, Collards, Sallads, and other Garden Stuff, belonging to the Governor and Officers. From the Plantation, or from the first Entering of the Palissades to the Factory, you walk on a wooden Platform. The Factory itself is a square Fort, having four Bastions, two Stories high, with a Platform on the Top leaded, and a Parapet, where they have some Cannon. The Factory is of Wood, built of large Logs of Trees, plained on three Sides, laid one on the other, and pegg'd together with large wooden Pins; to the Front they put a plain Side of the Logs, and the Front is painted white. In the Center of each Curtain there projects in the second Story a close Lanthern, a half Circle; in which nor in any Part of the Bastions are there any Ports for Cannon, but Loops for small Arms. When you go into the Factory there is a handsome Area; the Factory is much handsomer within than on the Outside."

Andrew Graham's description of York Factory is even more interesting, so far as the present narrative is concerned, as it gives us the fort as it appeared the year before Cocking's journey. - "On the north bank of the Hayes River," writes Graham, "three miles from the entrance. Famous River Nelson, three miles north, makes the land between an island. Well-built fort of wood, log on log. Four bastions with sheds between, and a breastwork with twelve small carriage guns. Good class of quarters, with double row of strong palisades. On the bank's edge, before the fort, is a half-moon battery of turf and earth, with fifteen cannon, nine-pounders. Two miles below the fort, same side, is a battery of ten twelve-pounders, with lodge-house and powder magazine. These two batteries command the river, but the shoals and sand-banks across the mouth defend us more. No ship comes higher than five miles below the fort. Governed like Prince of Wales Fort. Complement of men: forty-two. The natives come down Nelson River to trade. If weather calm, they paddle round the point. If not, they carry their furs across. This fort sends home from 7000 to 33,000 made beaver in furs, &c., and a small quantity of white whale oil." To complete the description, the following is taken from his account of Prince of Wales Fort, as Andrew Graham says York Factory was governed similarly: "Staff: a chief factor and officers, with sixty servants and tradesmen. The council, with discretionary power, consists of chief factor, second factor, surgeon, sloop and brig masters, and captain of Company's ship when in port. These answer and sign the general letter, sent yearly to directors. The others are accountant, trader, steward, armourer, ship-wright, carpenter, cooper, blacksmith, mason, tailor, and labourers. These must not trade with natives, under penalties for so doing. Council mess together, also servants. Called by bell to duty, work from six to six in summer; eight to four in winter. Two watch in winter, three in summer. In emergencies, tradesmen must work at anything. Killing of partridges the most pleasant duty. A ship of 200 ton burden, bearing provisions, arrives yearly in August or early September. Sails again in ten days, wind permitting, with cargo and those returning." After enumerating the several other posts on the Bay, Severn, Albany, Henley House, East Main House, and Moose Factory, Andrew Graham concludes: "All are under one discipline, and excepting the sub-houses, each factor receives a commission to act for benefit of Company, without being answerable to any person or persons in the Bay, more than to consult for good of Company in emergencies and to supply one another with trading goods, &c, if capable, the receiver giving credit for the same."

Ballantyne and other writers have described York Factory as it appeared at a later day, but that is not to the present purpose.

Note - Since this introduction was written, the writer has had an opportunity of discussing Cocking's course with Mr. J. B. Tyrrell, who is thoroughly familiar with the ground, Mr. Tyrrell is of opinion that Cocking did not go through Knee Lake, but left the Hayes route above that lake, paddled through Deer lake (which lies west of Knee lake), and up the river which flows into it, to Cross lake (Cocking's Pimochickomow), over Cross lake, up Nelson river, to the mouth of Kiskitto or Kiskittogisu river, up this river, which is easy travelling, and over a swampy portage into Minago river, up this latter river and over a portage to Moose lake (Cocking's Oteatowan Sockoegan).
