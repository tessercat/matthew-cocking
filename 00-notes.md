Matthew Cocking’s narrative may properly be regarded as a 
companion document to the Journal of ‘Anthony Hendry. edited for.the 
Royal Society last year, and published in the Transactions for 1907. The 
two Journals are closely. related, although the journeys they describe 
stand nearly twenty years apart. Not only were they both undertaken 
with the same objects—the exploration of the vast unknown region to the 
westward of Hudson Bay, and the persuading of the far -western tribes 
to bring their furs down to the Bay; bat they covered substantially the 
same ground. Both Hendry and Cocking started forth from York Fort, 
or York Factory as it is more familiarly known; both took the well- 
known Hayes route as far as Knee Lake, but from there struck off almost 
due west:to Cross Lake on the Nelson, following a route evidently at that 
time familiar to the men of the’Hudson’s Bay Company, but afterward 
forgotten, so much so in fact that this strip of territory is to-day counted 
among the smaller unexplored areas of the country. From Cross Lake, 
both travellers followed the Minago River to Moose Lake, and thence 
smaller streams to the Saskatchewan. As a description of this portion 
of the route has already been given in connection with Hendry's Journal, 
it will not be necessary to repeat it here. Cocking, like Hendry, asvented 
the Saskatchewan to the mouth of the Pasquia—always an important 
point in the annals of the fur trade—and for a few miles farther their 
courses were identical, but at Saskeram Lake, to which Cockinz applies 
‘the modest name of’ Maneneshahsquatanan Sakahegan, the two travellers 
took different roads. Hendry, it will be remembered, ascended Carrot 
River and then struck overland between Carrot River and the Red Deer, 
working around to the South Saskatchewan, which he crossed somewhere 
about Clark Crossing, north of the present toi of Saskatoon, thence to 
the Elbow of the North Saskatchewan, and then over the Great Plain 
to the Red Deer branch of the South Saskatchewan. which he crossed 
somewhere about Knechill Creck. Cocking, on the other hand, after 
traversing Saskeram Lake, again entered the Saskatchewsn, which he 
ascended to a point not many,mniles below the Forks. He notes in his 
Journal; “Formerly the French had a House here.”, He was evidently

about where the present H. B. post, Fort & a Come, stands, and where 
the French fur-traders had a small establishment before the cession of 
Canada. From this place Cocking travelled overland, in a general south- 
westerly direction, crossing the Sonth Saskatchewan somewhere below 
Clark Crossing, but striking Hendry’s old trail once more at or 
about the Elbow of thé North Saskatchewan, Following. the southern 
hank of the North Saskatchewan, Cocking “put up at a shallow creck 
named Mikisew or little Eagle Crock.” and then, leaving the river, he 
© came to some high land named Mikisew Wache, or Bagle hills.” Eagle 
Hill Creek enters the North Saskatchewan some distance above the Elbow, 
and the Eagle Hills still bear the same name: so that Cocking’s position 
can be acenrately placed at this time. From the Eagle Hills, he journeyed 
out into the plains, following an erratie course, and constantly looking 
oat for indications of the Archithinue Indians, or Blackfogt, as one of 
fhe main objects of hix journey was to indgee this, important tribe or 
confederacy fo trade their furs with the Tiidéon’s Bay Company.” He 
finally: joined a considerable body of Blackfeet, and although he failed, 
as Hendry had done many years before, to persuade them to bring their 
furs down to the Bay, he spent some time among them, and has left us 
an exceedingly interesting and valuable account of their character, man- 
ners and customs at the time of his visit. Here, again, Cocking’s 
narrative may profitably be compared with that of Hendry, who also has 
mich to say about this remarkable tribe. ° 
Tt may be noted that in both Hendry's*and Cocking’s cases, one of 
the main incentives to their expaditions inland was the increasing pres- 
sure of the rival far-traders from Canada, a pressure which eventually 
was to thoroughly awaken the Hudson's Bay Company from the dream 
of a peaceful and comfortable monopoly of the fur trade, and convince 
them that if they would hold their own they must no longer rest contig” 
with a string of posts around the shores of Hudson Bay, but must strike \ 
boldly inland and mect the enterprising and very energetic Canadian 
traders on theit own ground. In Hendry’s day the Canadian fur-traders 
whose competition was beginning to arouse the alarm of the Hudson's" 
Bay Company were French. When Cocking went inland, a couple of 
decades later, Canada had changed hands; but although the traders who 
now roamed far and wide throughout the immense fur country’ jest of 
the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay were British, like the Hudson's Bay 
men themselves,’ the competition was much more bitter and strenuous, 
than it had ever been hefore—which was, of course, entirely in keeping 
with the whole history of mankind. 
Although the Hudson’s Bay men contemptuously styled the Cana- 
dian traders “pedlers,” they were too'shrewd to igiore the strength of

their competition, and it was no doubt a direct result of this journey of 
Cocking’s that the year after his return to York Factory he was sent in- 
Jand again by Ohief Factor Andrew Graham, with Samuel Hearne, to” 
build Cumberland House on the Saskatchewan. When Alexander Henry 
visited Cumberland House, in October, 1775, he found it “garrisoned by 
Highlanders, from the Orkney Islands, and under the command of a 
‘Mr. Cockings, by whom. thou ‘unwelcome guests, we were treated-with 
much civility.” How long thereaiter Cocking remained in charge of 
Cumberland House, or what his subsequent history may have béen. there! 
is no present means of knowing, nor is any information available as to 
his life previous to his remarkable journey from York ‘Factory to the 
Blackfeet. country.* - 
It'may not be without interest to give two practically contemporary 
descriptions of the famous trading post of the Hudson’s Bay Comp: 
which was the starting-point of Cocking’s expedition, as of so many ather 
remarkable journeys in the eighteenth and nineteenth céntiaries. ~The 
first of these’is taken from Drage’s “Account of a Voyage for the Dis- 
corery of a North-West Passage by Hudson's Straights, to the Western 
and Southern Ocean of America, performed in the Year 1746 and 1747;” 
and the seodnd from Andrew Graham's account of the forts of the Hud- 
son’ Bay, Company in 1771, as given in Dr. George Bryce’s “ Remark- 
able History of the Hudson’s Bay Company,” Chapter xiii. - : 
“The situation .of ‘the Factory,” says Drage, “is a clear Space 
made in the Woods, which surround it on three Sides, the Factory having 
an open Front to the Water, from which it stands a small Distance with- 
in the Bank; to the North and Eastward covered with a good Battery. 
and to the South-East is a Dock for building or repairing either Sloops 
or Boats; behind the Battery, and between tliat and the Dock, there is 
a Space of land which they call’ the Plantation, and here the Indians 
who come to the Faglgry pitch their Tents; and there is generally a 
Tent,or two of old and fhfirm Indians, both Men and Wemen, who get 
their Maintenance from the Factcty. This Part, which is on the Back 
of the Battery and Dock, and called the Plantation, is separated from 
the Factory by two Rows of high Paliscades. between the first of which 
and the second are Storehouses, the Cookery and some Workshops, low 
built, and so placed’as they would be of little Service to an Enemy to 
cover an Attack of the Place. Within the inner Paligsades are small 
Spots of Turnips, Collards, Sallads, and other Garden Stuff, belonging

to the Governor and Officers. From the Plantation, ér from the first 
Entering of the Polissades to the Factory, you walk on a wooden Plat- 
jorm. The Factory itself is a square Fort, having four Bastions, two 
Stories high, with a Platform on the Top leaded, and a Parspet, where 
they have some Cannon, The Factory is of Wood, built of large Le; 
‘Trees, plained on three Sides, Jaid one on the other, and pegg’d together 
with large wooden Pins; to the Front-they put a plain Side of the Logs, 
and the Front is paintgd white, In the Center of each Curtain there 
projects in the,se¢ond Story a clase Lanthern. a half Circle; in which 
nor in any Part of the Bastions are there any Ports for Cannon, but 
Loops for small Arms. When you go into the Factory there is a hand- 
y ismuch handsomer within than on the Outside.” 
dress Grahams description of York Factory is even more interest- 
far as the present narrative is concerned, as it gives us the fort as 
it appeared the year hefore Cocking’s journey.—“ On the north bank of 
the Hayes River,” writes Graham, “three miles. from the entrance. 
rmous’ River Nelson, three miles north, makes tlie land between an 
island, Well-built fort of wood, log on log. Four Bactions with sheds 
between, and a breastwork with twelve small carriage guns. Good class 
of quarters. with Aguble row of strong palisades. On the bank’s edge, 
before the fort. is,a Itt€imoon baitérs, of turf and earth, with fifteen 
cannon. nine-pounders. Two miles below the fort, same side, is a battery 
of ten twelve-pounders, with lodge-house and powder magazine. ‘These 
‘vor batteries command the river, but the shoals and sand-banks across 
the mouth defend us snore. No ship comes higher than five miles below 
the fort. Governed like Prince of Wales Fort. Complement of men: 
forty-two. The natives come down Nelson River to trade. If weather 
calm, they paddle round the point. If not, they carry their furs across. 
‘This fort sends home from 1000 to $3,000 miade beaver in furs, &c,, and 
a small quantity of white whale oil.” To complete the description, the 
following is taken from*his account of Prince of Wales Fort, as Andrew 
Graham says York Fagtory was governed similarly: “Staff: a chief 
actor and officers, witl sixty servants and tradesmen. ‘The council, with 
diserotionary, power. consists of chief factof, second factor, surgeon, 
sloop and brig masters. and, captain of Company's éhip when in port. 
‘These answer and sign the genera] letfer, sent yearly to directors. ‘The 
others are accountant, tradet, steward, armourer, chip-wright, earpenter, 
cooper, blacksmith, mason, tailor, and labourers, ‘These must not trade 
with natives, under penalties for so doing. Council mess together, also servanis. Called by bell fo uty, work from six to six in summer; eight 
to four in winter. Two watch in winter, three in summer. In emer-

gencies, tradesmen must work at anything. Killing of partridges the 
‘most pleasant duty. A”ship of 200 ton burden, bearing. provisions, ar- 
ives yearly in ‘August or early September. Sails again in ten da 
wind permitting, with cargo and those returning.” After enumerating 
the sexera} other posts on the Bay, Severn, Albany, Henley House, East 
Main House, and Moose Factory, Andrew Graham concludes: “All are 
under ‘one discipline, and excepting the sub-houses, each factor receives 
1 commission to act for benefit of Company, without being answerable 
to any person ot persons in the Bay, more than to consult for good of... 
Company in emergencies and to supply one another with trading goods, 
&e, if capable, the receiver giving eredit for the same.” 
Ballantyne and other writers have described York Factory as it ap- 
peared at ¢ latérday, but that is not to the present purpose. 
      
  
 
      
Nore-LSince this introduction was written, the writer has had an oppor 
‘tunity of discussing Cocking’s course with air. J.B Tyrrell, who is thor- 
oughly familiar with the ground, Mr. Tyrrell Is of opinion that Cocking did 
not go through Knee iake, but left the Hayes route above that lake, paddled 
through Deer lake (which Hes west of Knee lake), and up the river which 
flows into it, to Cross lake (Cocking’s Pimochickomox), over Cross lake, up 
Nelson river, to ehimouth of Kiskitto or Kiskittogisu river, up this river, 
which 1s easy travelling, and over a swampy portage into Minago river, up 
this latter river and over a. portage to Moose lake (Cocking’s Oteatowan 
Sockoegan). : *
